DESCRIPTION: The program for implementing a singly linked list with operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal was written using the **Code::Blocks IDE**, a popular open-source C/C++ development environment that offers a user-friendly interface, built-in compiler integration, and real-time output viewing. Code::Blocks provides syntax highlighting, project management tools, and debugging support, making it ideal for writing modular and efficient C programs. Within this environment, I created a new C source file and structured the code into logical modules using functions to maintain clarity and reusability. The code begins by defining a `Node` structure that stores integer data and a pointer to the next node, forming the backbone of the singly linked list. To uphold modularity, each major operation—such as inserting a new node at the end (`insertEnd`), deleting a node by value (`deleteNode`), and traversing the list (`traverseList`)—is implemented as a separate function, making the code easier to maintain, debug, and expand in the future. The `createNode` function ensures memory is dynamically allocated for each new node, enhancing the flexibility and scalability of the list. The main function acts as a driver to demonstrate and test all operations in a sequence, providing clear examples of how nodes are added, deleted, and displayed in the linked list. In addition, the `freeList` function is used at the end to clean up memory and prevent memory leaks, an important aspect of writing efficient C programs. Throughout the code, standard C programming conventions and best practices are followed, such as passing pointers to functions for direct memory access and ensuring edge cases like empty lists or invalid deletions are properly handled with appropriate user feedback. The program is built for readability and efficiency, with each operation optimized to avoid unnecessary computation and ensure proper memory management. It demonstrates the core principles of data structure implementation, including dynamic memory allocation, pointer manipulation, and modular design. This makes the code not only suitable for academic submissions but also for practical applications where dynamic data structures are needed. Using Code::Blocks also allowed for easy compilation and testing, as its integrated build system and output console provided instant feedback during development. All in all, the program reflects a clean, well-documented, and functionally complete implementation of a singly linked list that is both easy to understand and ready for enhancement, such as adding more operations like insertion at the beginning, searching, or sorting. The project showcases foundational C programming and data structure knowledge in a real-world coding environment.
